In this aplication you can chose one of 5 currency:
- Euro
- US dolars
- British Pound
- Japanese yen

When you write a amout in polish zloty in input and press a red button "Przelicz" you get how much money you should get in chosen currency.

## Technology
In this project I use a BEM, Flex and Java Skrypt function. The exchange of a given currency is permanently entered. I didn't conect this aplication with any sever with exchange rates. This is a next step of develop this aplication.
